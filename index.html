    <p style="background-color: burlywood ;"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature">Nature</a>, in the broadest sense, is the physical world or universe.
        <span style="color: chartreuse;"> "Nature"can refer to the phenomena of the physical world,
        and also to life in general.</span>
        The study of nature is a large, if not the only, part of science. Although humans are part of nature, human
        activity is often understood as a separate category from other natural phenomena.The word nature is borrowed
        from the Old French nature and is
        derived from the Latin word natura, or "essential qualities, innate disposition", and in ancient times,
        literally meant "birth". In ancient philosophy, natura is mostly used as the Latin translation of the Greek
        word physis (φύσις), which originally related to the intrinsic characteristics of plants, animals, and other
        features of the world to develop of their own accord. The concept of nature as a whole, the physical
        universe, is one of several expansions of the original notion;it began with certain core applications of the
        word φύσις by pre-Socratic philosophers (though this word had a dynamic dimension then, especially for
        Heraclitus), and has steadily gained currency ever since.

        During the advent of modern scientific method in the last several centuries, nature became the passive reality,
        organized and moved by divine laws. With the Industrial revolution, nature increasingly became seen as the
        part of reality deprived from intentional intervention: it was hence considered as sacred by some traditions
        (Rousseau, American transcendentalism) or a mere decorum for divine providence or human history (Hegel, Marx).
        However, a vitalist vision of nature, closer to the pre-Socratic one, got reborn at the same time, especially
        after Charles Darwin.

        Within the various uses of the word today, "nature" often refers to geology and wildlife. Nature can refer to
        the general realm of living plants and animals, and in some cases to the processes associated with inanimate
        objects—the way that particular types of things exist and change of their own accord, such as the weather and
        geology of the Earth. It is often taken to mean the "natural environment" or wilderness—wild animals, rocks,
        forest, and in general those things that have not been substantially altered by human intervention, or which
        persist despite human intervention. For example, manufactured objects and human interaction generally are not
        considered part of nature, unless qualified as, for example, "human nature" or "the whole of nature". This more
        traditional concept of natural things that can still be found today implies a distinction between the natural
        and the artificial, with the artificial being understood as that which has been brought into being by a human
        consciousness or a human mind. Depending on the particular context, the term "natural" might also be
        distinguished from the unnatural or the supernatural.
