    <p style="background-color: darkgray;"><b>Nature</b>, in the broadest sense, is the physical world or universe. "Nature"
        can refer to the phenomena of the physical world, and also to life in general. The study of nature is a large,
        if not the only, part of science. Although humans are part of nature, human activity is often understood as a
        separate category from other natural phenomena.</p>
