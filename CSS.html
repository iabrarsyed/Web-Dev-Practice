            <b>Pahalgam</b>, village of shepherds in Kashmiri is a town and a notified area committee, near Anantnag
            city in
            the Anantnag district of the Indian-administered union territory of Jammu and Kashmir. It is
            a popular tourist destination and hill station. Its lush green meadows and pristine waters attract thousands
            of tourists from all over the world each year. It is located 45 kilometres (28 mi) from Anantnag on the
            banks of Lidder River at an altitude of 7,200 feet (2,200 m). Pahalgam is the headquarters of one of the
            eleven tehsils of Anantnag district. <br>

            Pahalgam is associated with the annual pilgrimage to the shrine Amarnath Yatra. Chandanwari, located 16
            kilometres (9.9 mi) from Pahalgam. The town is the starting point of the yatra that takes place every year
            in the months of July-August, receiving hundreds of thousands of tourists. Because of its religious
            significance and role as a base camp, the town attracts 70% of visitors to the valley. This flood of
            tourists overwhelms some of the local infrastructure, especially waste management in the town.
            The name Pahalgam is derived from two Kashmiri words;

            Puheyl (shepherd) and goam (village) over the time became Puheylgoam or Pahalgam.The place
            acts as a gateway to many meadows and pastures and traditional Bakharwal communities settle there from
            spring season to pre-winter, herding their cattle. <br>

            According to Hindu traditions, Pahalgam was originally called Bail Gaon (बैल गाँव) meaning (village of bull
            (nandi)), in other words, where Shiva left his bull before entering Amarnath Cave. <br>

            Pahalgam is located at 34.01°N 75.19°E.[12] Pahalgam holds a central position in the Lidder Valley. It has
            an average elevation of 2,740 metres (8,990 ft). <br>

            Pahalgam has a temperate climate with long and cold winter and short and mild summer. <br>

            As of 2011 India census, Pahalgam had a population of 5922. Males constitute 56% of the population and
            females 44%. The average literacy rate is 35%, lower than the Indian national average of 59.5% with male
            literacy at 49% and female literacy at 17%. About 14% of the population is under 6 years of age.

            Pahalgam is administered by the Pahalgam Development Authority, headed by a Chief Executive Officer who
            functions as the administrator of local town area committee. <br>

            <strong>Kolhoi Glacier</strong>
            Kolohoi Glacier, situated up the Lidder Valley, just below Kolhoi Peak is currently a hanging glacier. It is
            accessible from Pahalgam via Aru and is known to have extended for at least 35 kilometres (22 mi).
            According to the mountaineers from Jawahar Institute of Mountaineering, in 2008, the glacier receded by half
            since 1985 and it is not safe to study because it is hollow and has 200-foot-deep (61 m) crevices. <br>

            <strong>Betaab Valley</strong>
            Also known as Hagoon or Hagan Valley, locally.
            Betaab Valley is a valley located 15 kilometres (9.3 mi) from Pahalgam. The valley got its name from a
            Bollywood movie Betaab that was shot here. <br>

            <strong>Baisaran Valley</strong>
            Baisaran Valley, barely 5 kilometres from Pahalgam in Kashmir's Anantnag district, is a popular tourist
            attraction that has been dubbed "mini-Switzerland" due to its scenic splendour. It's a verdant meadow on a
            mountaintop flanked by snowcapped mountains and studded with thick pine woods. The optimum time to go to
            Baisaran is determined on the type of experience you wish to have. From January through March is the best
            time to visit if you want to experience the snow. Visit there during April and June to appreciate the
            foliage and lovely weather.
