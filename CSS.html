            1. <b>Pahalgam</b>, village of shepherds in Kashmiri is a town and a notified area committee, near Anantnag
            city in
            the Anantnag district of the Indian-administered union territory of Jammu and Kashmir. It is
            a popular tourist destination and hill station. Its lush green meadows and pristine waters attract thousands
            of tourists from all over the world each year. It is located 45 kilometres (28 mi) from Anantnag on the
            banks of Lidder River at an altitude of 7,200 feet (2,200 m). Pahalgam is the headquarters of one of the
            eleven tehsils of Anantnag district. <br>

            Pahalgam is associated with the annual pilgrimage to the shrine Amarnath Yatra. Chandanwari, located 16
            kilometres (9.9 mi) from Pahalgam. The town is the starting point of the yatra that takes place every year
            in the months of July-August, receiving hundreds of thousands of tourists. Because of its religious
            significance and role as a base camp, the town attracts 70% of visitors to the valley. This flood of
            tourists overwhelms some of the local infrastructure, especially waste management in the town.
            The name Pahalgam is derived from two Kashmiri words;

            Puheyl (shepherd) and goam (village) over the time became Puheylgoam or Pahalgam.The place
            acts as a gateway to many meadows and pastures and traditional Bakharwal communities settle there from
            spring season to pre-winter, herding their cattle. <br>

            According to Hindu traditions, Pahalgam was originally called Bail Gaon (बैल गाँव) meaning (village of bull
            (nandi)), in other words, where Shiva left his bull before entering Amarnath Cave. <br>

            Pahalgam is located at 34.01°N 75.19°E.[12] Pahalgam holds a central position in the Lidder Valley. It has
            an average elevation of 2,740 metres (8,990 ft). <br>

            Pahalgam has a temperate climate with long and cold winter and short and mild summer. <br>

            As of 2011 India census, Pahalgam had a population of 5922. Males constitute 56% of the population and
            females 44%. The average literacy rate is 35%, lower than the Indian national average of 59.5% with male
            literacy at 49% and female literacy at 17%. About 14% of the population is under 6 years of age.

            Pahalgam is administered by the Pahalgam Development Authority, headed by a Chief Executive Officer who
            functions as the administrator of local town area committee. <br>

        <strong>Baisaran Valley</strong>
        Baisaran Valley, barely 5 kilometres from Pahalgam in Kashmir's Anantnag district, is a popular tourist
        attraction that has been dubbed "mini-Switzerland" due to its scenic splendour. It's a verdant meadow on a
        mountaintop flanked by snowcapped mountains and studded with thick pine woods. The optimum time to go to
        Baisaran is determined on the type of experience you wish to have. From January through March is the best

        Mahaguna Parbat, five elements at Panchtarni. Mahaguna Parbat is lies at Nagaparbhat.

            2. <b>Doodhpathri</b> known as Valley of Milk is a tourist destination
            and a hill station located in the Khansahib tehsil of the Budgam district of Jammu and Kashmir, India.
            Situated at an altitude of 2,730 metres (8,960 ft) from sea level, it is located at a distance of 42 km (26
            mi) from Jammu and Kashmir's summer capital, Srinagar, and 30 km (19 mi) from district headquarters, Budgam.
            <br>
            The name "Doodhpathri" means "Valley of Milk." It is said that the famous poet and saint of Kashmir,
            "Sheikh-Ul-Aalam" Sheikh- Noor-Ud-Din Noorani, has prayed here, and once, when he was in search of water in
            the meadows to offer prayers, he pricked the ground with his stick to search for water, and milk came out.
            He told the milk that it could only be used for drinking and not for ablution. Hearing this, milk at once
            changed its state to water, and the meadow got its name "Doodhpathri".[5] The water that is currently
            flowing through the meadows has a milky appearance from a distance and remains very cold throughout the
            year. The lush green grasses over the vast meadows and silver-shining streams running over the large stones
            further increase its beauty. Doodhpathri is a sloping grassy landscape with a diversity of multicolored
            flowers up to Chang. The famous Tosamaidan lies to the west of Doodhpathri. <br>
            Doodhpathri lies in a bowl shaped valley in the Pir Panjal Range of the Himalayas, at an altitude of 2,730
            metres (8,960 ft) above sea level. It is an alpine valley covered with snow-clad mountains and meadows of
            pine, fir and deodar. The natural meadows, which are covered with snow in winter, allow the growth of wild
            flowers such as daisies, forget-me-nots, and buttercups during spring and summer. <br>
            Doodhpathri does not have any permanent settlements, and during the winter months it is inaccessible due to
            the severe snowfall. Shepherds from the plains of the district Budgam send their cattle to Doodhpathri in
            the summer for grazing, and they tend to stay there seasonally for approximately six months.
